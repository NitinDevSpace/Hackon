# Innovatrix Frontend

## Project Overview

The Innovatrix frontend is a React application built with Vite, designed to provide a fast, responsive, and modern user interface for the Innovatrix project. This frontend serves as the client-side interface where users can interact with the Innovatrix platform seamlessly.

## Features

- Fast and optimized React application using Vite for development and build
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant feedback during development
- Clean and modular codebase for easy maintenance and scalability
- Integration with backend APIs (to be configured)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- ESLint configured for code quality and consistency

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and development
- **JavaScript / JSX**: Core programming language and templating
- **ESLint**: Linting and code quality enforcement
- **CSS / Sass**: Styling the application (customize as needed)

## Installation

To get started with the Innovatrix frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Innovatrix.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd Innovatrix/client
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you use Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

## Running the Project

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the app in your default browser. Any code changes will be reflected instantly.

### Production Build

To create a production build of the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

The optimized build will be output to the `dist` folder.

### Preview Production Build

To locally preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

or

```bash
yarn preview
```
